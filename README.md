# Sudoku-AI-Solver-using-Recursive-Backtracking
This was another assignment I completed for my Advanced Computer Science class I took my Junior year. 

In this assignment, I had to, given a two dimensional Sudoku board found in a text file, print out a solved version of that board (after processing the text file's contents and running a solve() function of some sort). 

This solution to this assignment relied primarily on recursive backtracking, and it was coded exclusively in Java.
